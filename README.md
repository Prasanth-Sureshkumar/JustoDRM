This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

# Security Features

## Screenshot Prevention

This app implements screenshot prevention to protect sensitive content from being captured.

### Implementation

Screenshot prevention is implemented using the `FLAG_SECURE` window flag in the `MainActivity.kt` file.

This flag prevents users from:
- Taking screenshots of the app
- Recording the screen while the app is visible
- Viewing the app content in the recent apps overview

The implementation is applied in the `onCreate()` method to ensure protection is active from app launch.


## Encryption & Decryption

### Dependencies

- **react-native-quick-crypto**: High-performance cryptographic operations for React Native

### Supported Content Types

The encryption system supports multiple digital content formats:
- **EPUB Books**: Digital publications with full content protection
- **MP3 Audio Files**: Audio content with secure streaming capabilities

### Implementation Architecture

#### Client-Side Decryption
- Encrypted content is received and stored securely on the client device
- Decryption occurs in real-time during content consumption
- Decrypted content is never stored permanently on the device

#### Content Protection Features

- **Dynamic Watermarking**: Customizable watermarks overlaid on book content to prevent unauthorized redistribution
- **Text Selection Prevention**: Disables text selection, copying, and cut operations
- **Context Menu Blocking**: Prevents right-click context menus and copy operations
- **Keyboard Shortcut Blocking**: Disables common copy shortcuts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+A, etc.)
- **Print Protection**: Blocks printing functionality to prevent physical copies


#### Security Measures

1. **Device Security**
   - Screenshot prevention at the OS level
   - Screen recording detection and blocking

2. **Anti-Piracy Features**
   - Watermarking with user identification
   - Copy protection mechanisms

# Getting Started with Development

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
